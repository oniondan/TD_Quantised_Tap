V1 of this is tap the button and then the limit chop has the quantise function to qunatize the values to what ever quantise value you want. 
Then the beat chop checks against those values and prints tap.
That's as far as I have gotten with this. Will work on more later. If tou want to assist then clone and submit a branch.
